# Sorting Visualizer
•	Created a GUI based application using Pygame package in python that visualizes five different sorting algorithms<br />
•	The application allows to user to select the algorithm and speed of visualization to compare the execution time of different algorithms<br />
•	Implemented multiple sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort<br />

**Merge Sort:-**
Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. It is one of the most respected algorithms. Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.<br />

**Quick Sort:-**
Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value. Quicksort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays.<br />

**Bubble Sort:-**
Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.<br />
